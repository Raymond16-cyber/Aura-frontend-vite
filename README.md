# AURA — Minimal Desktop Widget Overlay

AURA is a sleek, lightweight desktop overlay that lets you place widgets like clock, weather, shortcuts, and quotes directly on your desktop — without opening an app or cluttering your workspace.

## ✨ Features

* **Widgets on the desktop** — clock, weather, quotes, shortcuts
* **Draggable & resizable** — place widgets anywhere on your desktop
* **Minimal & aesthetic UI** — transparency, blur, custom themes
* **Lightweight** — runs silently in background
* **Live updates** — auto-refreshes weather, time, and quotes

## 🧠 Why AURA?

Instead of opening multiple apps just to check simple things, AURA keeps the essentials right in front of you — quietly, aesthetically.

> Focus more. Click less.
